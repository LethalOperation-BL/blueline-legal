1. Acceptance of Terms  
By installing, inviting, or using Blueline Protection (“the Bot”), you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not use the Bot.

2. License Usage  
Each license key is valid for one (1) Discord server unless explicitly stated otherwise.

4. Bot Functionality  
The Bot provides moderation, verification, and anti-raid features.  
These features require reading messages, monitoring joins, logging moderation actions, and communicating with Discord servers.

5. Data Handling  
The Bot stores server configuration, moderation logs, and verification data as required for functionality.  
No data is sold, transferred, or used for advertising.

6. Termination  
We may suspend or terminate licenses at any time for:  
• Violation of this ToS  
• Abuse of the Bot  
• Unauthorized distribution  
• Chargebacks or fraudulent purchases

7. Availability  
The Bot is provided "as-is" with no guaranteed uptime, though we strive to maintain stable operation.

Digital licenses are non-refundable unless legally required.

9. Changes to the Terms  
We may update these Terms at any time. Continued use of the Bot indicates acceptance of updated terms.
